## CanvOS vs. CanvOS2

This project is both called CanvOS and CanvOS2. this is because I made a CanvOS a while ago, but used a really slow canvas graphics implementation (i drew a bunch of 1x1 rectangles). I never released CanvOS, and thus this project is simultaneously CanvOS and CanvOS2.

Submit an issue [here](https://github.com/creatively-stupid/canvos/issues/new) if you have any problems.
